Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Christopher Soto, I'm a current senior at CUNY Queens College studying Applied Mathematics under the pre-engineering program with Columbia University, where I will continue my education in studying Computer Science in the Fall 2021 semester.

I'm passionate about using Mathematics and Computer Science in collaboration with other academic disciplines to solve real-world problems and make an impact in society to change the daily lives of individuals.
