Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Christopher Soto, I'm a current graduate student at Johns Hopkins University pursuing an MS in Computer Science. I previously studied at Columbia University, where I obtained my BS in Computer Science, and at CUNY Queens College where I completed my BA in Mathematics.

I'm passionate about using Mathematics and Computer Science in collaboration with other academic disciplines to solve real-world problems and make an impact in society to change the daily lives of individuals.
