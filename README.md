Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Christopher Soto, I'm a current senior at Columbia University pursuing a BS in Computer Science under the pre-engineering program with CUNY Queens College, where I completed a BA in Mathematics.

I'm passionate about using Mathematics and Computer Science in collaboration with other academic disciplines to solve real-world problems and make an impact in society to change the daily lives of individuals.
